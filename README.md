## ðŸš€ About Me
At the point of creating this project I am a high-school programmer in the 11th grade working on improving my skills as a software developper

This project was made with the intention to get back in the flow of programming in C after a pretty long break. This should also be the first public repository of a project I make, even though I have had multiple projects in the past
